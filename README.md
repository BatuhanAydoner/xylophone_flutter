## My Goal
In this tutorial I will be diving into more Dart programming concepts and learning how to use open source Flutter packages. By the end of this app, I can use Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.

## What I Created
I made a music app that plays Xylophone sounds.This will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.

## What I Learned
* How to incorporate open source libraries of code into your project using Flutter Packages.
* How to play sound on both iOS and Android.
* How to generate repeated user interface Widgets.
* How to use Dart functions that can take input arguments as well as return an output.
* Dart arrow syntax for writing one line functions.
